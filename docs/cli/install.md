Install the build artifacts
Usage: catalyst install [OPTIONS] --target <path>

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  -p,--profiles TEXT ...      The profiles to compose in the build artifact (default: common)

## Description

The `install` command copies the built artifacts (executables, libraries) and public headers to a specified installation directory. It organizes them into standard subdirectories (`bin/`, `lib/`, `include/`) within the target path.

You must run `catalyst build` before running `catalyst install`.

## Examples

**Install to a local `dist` folder:**
```bash
catalyst install --target ./dist
```

**Install a debug build:**
```bash
catalyst install --target ./dist --profiles debug
```

**Install from a specific source directory:**
```bash
catalyst install --source ./my-project --target /opt/my-project
```
