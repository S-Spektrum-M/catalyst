Current PR Goals
---

Basically, I wanna rework this thing from the screatch. That includes the following for 1:

1. Having the project profile be a static struct.
2. Having the CLI args be a long lived struct.
2. Having utilities for
    - Deciphering CLI
    - Using CLI

After the end of this branch, it STILL won't be functional, but we'll have a better skeleton to build off of.
