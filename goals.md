- Goals:
    - ``catalyst pack`` -- package a artifact and dependencies if required
    - ``catalyst install`` -- install a dependency to path, directly from source code.
    - ``catalyst install git`` -- install a dependency to path, directly from repo.
        - basically git clone "path" + catalyst install.
