- Goals:
    - [ ] ``catalyst pack`` -- package a artifact and dependencies if required
    - [x] ``catalyst install`` -- install a dependency to path, directly from source code.
    - [ ] ``catalyst git-install`` -- install a dependency to path, directly from repo.
        - basically git clone "remote" + catalyst install.
