> [!WARNING]
> Catalyst is currently in early development. APIs and features are subject to change.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation refers to binaries built from the 1.1.0 tag.

Catalyst is a next-generation build system for C++ that aims to bring the ease of use of declarative configuration to
the C++ ecosystem. It prioritizes declarative configuration, reproducibility, and developer experience.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Configuration**: Define your project with simple YAML files. No more complex CMake scripting.
- **Profile Composition**: Mix and match build configurations (e.g., `debug`, `release`, `asan`) easily.
- **Dependency Management**: Built-in support for `vcpkg`, `git` repositories, local packages, and system libraries.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Designed for determinism and isolation.
- **Modern C++ Support**: Built for C++20 and beyond.
