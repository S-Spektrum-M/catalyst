## What is Catalyst?

Catalyst is a declarative build system that brings Cargo-like simplicity to C and C++. No more wrestling with CMake scripts or Makefiles—just clean YAML configuration and reproducible builds.

**Why Catalyst?**

- Declarative – YAML config files instead of scripting languages.
- Profile-based builds – Compose configurations like `debug + asan` or `release + lto`.
- Built-in dependency management – Native support for vcpkg, git repos, local packages, and system libraries.
- Reproducible by default – Per-target isolation with deterministic builds.
- Modern C++ focused – Designed for C++20/23/26 workflows.
